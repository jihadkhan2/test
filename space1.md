**Home**

Welcome to Tomb.finance, home to the first algorithmic token pegged to $FTM on the Fantom Opera network.

**The Big Picture**

The $MARIO algorithmic token serves as the backbone of a rapidly growing ecosystem aimed towards bringing liquidity and [new use cases to the Opera network.](https://docs-mario.gitbook.io/finance/)

The protocol's underlying mechanism dynamically adjusts $MARIO's supply, pushing its price up or down relative to the price of $FTM.

Inspired by the original idea behind Basis as well as its predecessors (bDollar and soup), mario.finance is a multi-token protocol which consists of the following three tokens:

-Mario ($MARIO).

-Mario Shares ($LUIGI) -Mario Bonds ($WARIO).![](Aspose.Words.799c96fa-9a33-4615-a7d0-81fb30e74346.001.png)

**What differentiates $MARIO from other algorithmic tokens?**

Unlike previous algorithmic tokens, $MARIO is not pegged to a stable coin— it is instead pegged to $FTM. Why is this?

Mario.Finance believes in the potential of Fantom Opera, and has chosen to align its mission to both provide [value to and derive value from $FTM's future growth. In addition to existing and future use cases such as FTMPad, $MARIO aims to become the main medium of exchange on Fantom Opera: this will be achieved by providing a mirrored, liquid asset to $FTM. ](https://docs-mario.gitbook.io/finance/)

One of the primary shortcomings of past algorithmic tokens has been a lack of use cases, leaving no good reason for somebody to want to use or hold them. In order to successfully maintain the peg in the long-run, the Tomb team will maintain a focus on innovation around enhanced functionality and use cases.
